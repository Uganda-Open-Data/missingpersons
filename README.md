5. Filtering

    The API supports Associative Array notation to filter.
    
    Use the `filter[key]` URL param to return specific items

    Where the `key` can be replaced with `status` or `holding_location_id`

    `filter[key]` supports one of the following options. 
      
    - status: `filter[status] = Remanded or Arrested or Missing or Released or Fallen`

    - holding_location_id: `filter[holding_location_id] = 1`
      
    **Examples:**

    - _Filter by status_

        Remanded
        
        `GET https://dashboard.missingpersonsug.org/api/victims?filter[status]=Remanded`

        Arrasted
        
        `GET https://dashboard.missingpersonsug.org/api/victims?filter[status]=Arrested`

    - _Filter by Holding Location_

        Holding Location
        
        `GET https://dashboard.missingpersonsug.org/api/victims?filter[holding_location_id]=1`
